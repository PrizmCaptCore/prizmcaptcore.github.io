Welcome to my new blog powered by Jekyll! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my journey in software development, system administration, and open-source projects.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Linux & System Administration**: Tips and tricks for managing Linux systems
- **DevOps & Automation**: Tools and workflows that improve productivity
- **Open Source Projects**: Updates on my projects like PRIZM NAS OS
- **Programming**: Code snippets, tutorials, and best practices

## Why Jekyll?

I chose Jekyll for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Write posts in Markdown
2. **GitHub Pages Integration**: Automatic deployment
3. **Customization**: Full control over design and functionality
4. **Speed**: Static site generation is fast and secure

## Stay Tuned

I'll be posting regularly about my projects and technical discoveries. Follow along for updates on PRIZM NAS OS and other exciting developments!

Thanks for reading! 🚀
